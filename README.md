# My Scuba Log

This is a simple website that can be used as an online personal diving log. It has all the standard feature required to log a dive in line with PADI requirements. Divers can create an account to log and edit their dives. Users can create accounts to comment on the logged dives. 

This application demonstrates by ability to use Ruby (6.0) on Rails to create dynamic pages with interactive content using HTML and CSS. All pages have a consistent sidebar and menu for navigation. Using bootstrap, I was able to create an aesthetic and consistent theme between the pages. Users are managed using devise and auth. I also learnt how to use database technologies, namely PostgreSQL and SQLite for production and development. Integration tests have been used to verify intended functionality. 

The application has been deployed online using Heroku at https://scuba-log.herokuapp.com
